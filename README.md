# The Developer's Guide to Passkey Authentication

This repository is part of a tutorial on setting up Passkeys in a React app using [Descope](https://www.descope.com/). To get started with the code in this repository, clone it locally and:
1. Set up a [new Descope account](https://www.descope.com/sign-up).
2. Create [a new Descope Flow](https://docs.descope.com/build/guides/gettingstarted/) with Passkeys(WebAuthn) as the primary authentication method.
3. Retrieve the project ID in which you created the new flow and update it in the main.jsx file.
4. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the app.
